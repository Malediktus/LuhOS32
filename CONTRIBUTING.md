## Commit Message Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for our commit messages. A conventional commit message should have the following structure:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <description>
   ```

- `<type>`: Describes the purpose of the commit (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
- `<scope>` (optional): Describes the part of the project that is affected by the commit.
- `<description>`: A brief, concise summary of the changes made.

### Examples of Commit Messages

- `feat(kernel): Implement multitasking functionality`
- `fix(shell): Resolve issue with command parsing`
- `docs(readme): Update system requirements section`
- `style(formatting): Reformat code according to style guidelines`
- `refactor(memory): Optimize memory allocation code`
